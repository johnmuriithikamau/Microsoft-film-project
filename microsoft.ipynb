    "# Project for microsoft getting into films Business\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. We will be  exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio will use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Reading im.db.zip and bom.movie_gross.csv.gz data from files into Python objects\n",
    "* Exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.\n",
    "* Cleaning data (filtering, normalizing locations, converting types)\n",
    "*  Combine data from multiple sources into a single data structure\n",
    "*  Interpret descriptive statistics and data visualizations to present findings\n",
